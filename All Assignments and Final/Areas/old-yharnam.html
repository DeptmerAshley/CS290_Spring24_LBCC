        <p>Old Yharnam is a desolate and abandoned district in Bloodborne, shrouded in fog and plagued by beasts. Once a thriving part of the city, it was burned down and quarantined to contain the spread of the beastly scourge.</p>
        
        <h2>The History of Old Yharnam</h2>
        <p>Old Yharnam was once a prosperous district, but it fell victim to a terrible outbreak of the beast plague. In a desperate attempt to control the infection, the Healing Church decided to burn the entire area, sealing it off from the rest of Yharnam. The ruins of Old Yharnam stand as a grim reminder of the city's dark past.</p>

                The Healing Church's decision to burn Old Yharnam was controversial, but it was deemed necessary to prevent the plague from spreading further. The area is now overrun with beasts and is avoided by most of Yharnam's inhabitants. Hunters, however, venture into Old Yharnam to uncover its secrets and combat the lingering threats.
