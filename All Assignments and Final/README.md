Majority of requirements for most assignments are completed. 1-4 are basically met with full requirements. Still working on Assign 5 and final project. Looking toi make one cohesive project. Server side will be kept on one page. Having trouble setting the node for server side.

Webpage now contains all elements needed for final project and assignments. I am having a hard time using my page on a local server. I downloaded the correct compiler/code to port it out but my computer is not liking it for some reason. THere is code there for implementation but not executing.
