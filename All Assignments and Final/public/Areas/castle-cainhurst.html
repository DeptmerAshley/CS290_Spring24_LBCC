                The Vilebloods were known for their use of tainted blood, which granted them power and longevity. However, their practices were deemed heretical by the Healing Church, leading to a violent purge. The castle was abandoned, and its halls now echo with the whispers of its former inhabitants.

            <h3>The Vilebloods</h3>
            <p>
                The Vilebloods were a noble family that practiced forbidden blood rituals. They believed in using tainted blood to gain power and immortality. Their practices were considered blasphemous by the Healing Church, leading to a violent conflict between the two factions.
            </p>
            <h4>The Betrayal</h4>
            <p>
                The Healing Church sent Martyr Logarius and his executioners to purge the Vilebloods. The conflict was brutal, and many Vilebloods were slain. Martyr Logarius himself became cursed by the very blood he sought to destroy, ultimately becoming a guardian of the castle.
            </p>
            <h4>Key Figures</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Queen Annalise:</strong> Queen Annalise is the ruler of the Vilebloods and a central figure in their lore. She remains in Castle Cainhurst, seeking new blood dregs to continue her dark rituals.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Martyr Logarius:</strong> Once a devout executioner, Logarius became a martyr in his quest to eradicate the Vilebloods. His transformation into a twisted being reflects the corrupting power of the blood he sought to destroy.
