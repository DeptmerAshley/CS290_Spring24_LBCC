    I have an idea for a chat type of service that involves video games. It is a service that I would terget for players that are new to games, 
    especially RPG type games where adventuring, items, enemies and bosses are very involved. The service would look similaer to a guide. 
    When you start, it may show a guide or give tips on how to make a charachter. It can give hints and reveal items in the area as you progress. 
    Players would also be able to add comments and reply as they progress through the game. If someone blatently gives away an answer that can be helped by giving an 
    option to warn people, or allow other users to flag it and later be approved. More thoughts on this system could come later. 
    This service aims to be almost like an interactive checklist/gamer blog that keeps communities integrated into one area. 
    I will be basing my project around the video game Bloodborne.
